# NameSearchCsharp
Added the ability to add and searching by creating a new list, while looping, and selecting from switch-case. 
The Linq library belonging to C# was used for searching. 
In this query, the type letters in the word being queried with the where constraint are made lowercase, the StartsWith() method is used. 
Determines whether the beginning of this string instance matches the specified string. 
A new list is created using the ToList() method for values from this resulting constraint. 
The restricted values in this list are also printed to the console with foreach.
